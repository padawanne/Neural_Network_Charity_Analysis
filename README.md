# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Project Overview
This analysis using machine learning and neural networks aims at creating a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
This includes 
- processing data for a neural network model
- compiling, training, and evaluating the model
- optimizing the model

### Resources
Data: charity_data.csv

## Results
The model did not reach the accuracy rate of 75% and therefore isn't performing well enough to be used.
